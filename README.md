# Frontend-Developer-Blog

---

Hyper Island - The Fundamentals Module - Brief 1.

### :open_file_folder: The Brief:

Design and develop a Personal Portfolio or Blog. The primary objective is to build upon our JavaScript, CSS and HTML skills. A secondary objective was to fetch posts from a data source e.g. JSON file or WordPress CMS.

The website does not need to be mobile responsive for this brief.

### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Time spent / Deadline:

6 weeks.

### :dart: Goals:

At this stage, I wanted to leave my portfolio for later down the line once I'd tightened up skills in general. I went with a blog and set myself the following goals.

- Get stuck into Figma, have opinions on good/bad design, accessibility and site structure.
- Broaden programming skills, build a responsive site and have fun with UI animations.
- Make use of a fetch API and deep dive on dynamic pages / data handling.

Although this was a personal project, we picked a team of 10 as a support network. I built in time for others to help/learn from roadblocks on their projects too.

### :mechanical_arm: Solution:

I planned to start simple and add on complexity as I progressed. I found Figma a fantastic tool and enjoyed using it. I love that you can use the mobile buddy app to navigate through a mocked-up app design. Figma helped me design out the blog in full and remain organised. I'm excited by the teamwork capabilities of the tool for future projects.

With a solid design foundation, building out the minimalist design was straightforward. I integrated a JSON file to fetch posts, added search functionality through JS and connected a Contact Me function via Mailchimp.

I used Axios and the GitHub API to link endpoints to my Github (name/userID/avatar_url/followers/following/public_repos) and publish it within the profile section of the index page.

With help from our lecturer (and using his server), I was able to integrate WordPress REST API and used undpoints for post pages and comments.

### :man_student: Learnings:

- The importance of Stack overflow
- The power of API's
- Animations are a lot of fun really enjoyed using teh AOS library
- Discussing issues as a group and working together on solutions was very helpfull
- Feel more confident in Figma, responsive design, CSS and JS

### :computer: Tech used in this specific repository:

- Figma
- HTML
- CSS
- [AOS - Animate on scroll library](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos)
- JavaScript
- JSON
- MAMP
- [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/#using-the-wordpress-rest-api)
- [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/api_intro)
- Mailchimp

### :thought_balloon: Evaluation:

I found working with API's very interesting, and there are a few loose ends I still need to tie up, such as post page pagination. I need to improve my understanding of the WordPress API and its capabilities.

I need to spend more time with JS, so I will double down efforts here for my next module.
