Hyper Island - The Fundamentals Module - Brief 1.

### :open_file_folder: The Brief:

Design and develop a Personal Portfolio or Blog. The primary objective is to build upon our JavaScript, CSS and HTML skills. A secondary objective was to fetch posts from a data source e.g. JSON file or WordPress CMS.

### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Time spent / Deadline:

6 weeks.

### :dart: Goals:

I went with a blog and set myself the following goals.

- Get stuck into Figma, have opinions on good/bad design, accessibility and site structure.
- Broaden programming skills, build a responsive site and have fun with UI animations.
- Make use of a fetch API and deep dive on dynamic pages/data handling.

Although this was a personal project, we picked a team of 10 as a support network. I built in time for others to help/learn from roadblocks on their projects too.

### :mechanical_arm: Solution:

Figma helped me design out the blog in full and remain organised. I'm excited by the teamwork capabilities of the tool for future projects.

With a solid design foundation, building out the minimalist design was straightforward. I integrated a JSON file to fetch posts, added search functionality through JS and connected a Contact Me function via Mailchimp.

I used Axios and the GitHub API to link endpoints to my Github (name/userID/avatar_url/followers/following/public_repos) and publish it within the profile section of the index page.

Using the Google Maps API, I was able to plot Hyper Island on a map along with local pubs and customise colours to match the site design.

I integrated the WordPress REST API and used endpoints for post pages, comments and pagination.

### :man_student: Learnings:

- Just how useful Stack overflow is!
- The power of API's
- Animations are a lot of fun. I enjoyed using the AOS library and keyframes to inject personality.
- Discussing hurdles as a group and working through issues & solutions worked well and proved rewarding.
- Feel more confident in Figma, responsive design, CSS, JS and integrating APIs.
