# Frontend-Developer-Blog

Hyper Island - The Fundamentals Module - Brief 1.

### :open_file_folder: The Brief:

Design and develop a Personal Portfolio or Blog. The primary objective is to build upon our JavaScript, CSS and HTML skills. A secondary objective was to fetch posts from a data source e.g. JSON file or WordPress CMS.

The website does not need to be mobile responsive for this brief.

### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Time spent / Deadline:

6 weeks.

### :dart: Goals:

At this stage, I wanted to leave my portfolio for later down the line once I'd tightened up skills in general. I went with a blog and set myself the following goals.

- Get stuck into Figma, have opinions on good/bad design, accessibility and site structure.
- Broaden programming skills, build a responsive site and have fun with UI animations.
- Make use of a fetch API and deep dive on dynamic pages / data handling.

Although this was a personal project, we picked a team of 10 as a support network. I built in time for others to help/learn from roadblocks on their projects too.

### :heavy_check_mark: Solution:

I planned to start simple and add on complexity as I went. I found Figma a fantastic tool and enjoyed using it. I love that you can use the mobile buddy app to navigate through a mocked-up app design. Figma helped me design out the blog in full and remain organised. I'm excited by the teamwork capabilities of the tool for future projects.

With a solid design foundation, building out the minimalist design was straightforward. I integrated a JSON file to fetch posts, add search functionality through JS and connect the site to Mailchimp.

I used Axios to integrate Github profile data to my homepage and display my latest repos. With help from our lecturer (and using his server), I was able to integrate WordPress posts with comments.
